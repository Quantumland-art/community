### About

DESY’s Centre for Quantum Technologies and Applications and the University of Plymouth’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR) are pleased to announce the 2nd International Symposium on Quantum Computing and Musical Creativity. The event is scheduled to take place in Berlin, Germany, on October 5th and 6th 2023.

The symposium will focus on the emerging field of quantum computer music, which has been made possible due to the rapid advancements in quantum computing technology. Since the 1950s, there has been extensive research into using computers for music, and today they are indispensable to the music industry. As quantum computing technology continues to develop, it is bound to have a profound impact on the future of music. This symposium will provide a platform for scientists, artists, and technologists to present and discuss their approaches to developing and using quantum computing technology in music.

ISQCMC II is a follow-up from the [first symposium in 2021](https://iccmr-quantum.github.io/1st_isqcmc/), which resulted in the pioneering book [Quantum Computer Music](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-13909-3), published by Springer in 2022.
