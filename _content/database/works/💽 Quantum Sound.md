Quantum Sound: A Performance of Superconducting Instruments

In the frame of a year-long artistic residency at the Yale Quantum Institute in 2019, artist and technologist Spencer Topel and quantum physicists Kyle Serniak and Luke Burkhart collaborated to create Quantum Sound, the first-ever music created and performed directly from measurements of superconducting quantum devices. Using analog- and digital-signal-processing sonification techniques, the team transformed GHz-frequency signals from experiments inside dilution refrigerators into audible sounds. The project was performed live at the International Festival of Arts and Ideas in New Haven, Connecticut on June 14, 2019 as a structured improvisation using the synthesis methods. At the interface between research and art, Quantum Sound represents an earnest attempt to produce a sonic reflection of the quantum realm.

Recorded live in the intimate space of New Havenâ€™s premiere recording studio Firehouse 12.
