'Interpreting Quantum Randomness' is an interdisciplinary research project conducted by composer and sound artist Reiko Yamada and quantum physicist Maciej Lewenstein at ICFO (Institute of Photonic Sciences) in Barcelona. This unusual collaboration stems from their common interest in quantum randomness, an area in which Lewenstein is a leading expert. Together with other researchers at ICFO, they had countless conversations on this subject and other key concepts in quantum physics.

With methods combining both digital and analogue tools, Yamada created sound gestures and graphic notations for improvising musicians (Barbara Held, Artur Majewski, Ilona Schneider, Vasco Trilla). Additionally, the team commissioned two composer-performers, Andrés Lewin-Richter and Ángel Faraldo to create their own interpretations from quantum random data.

The album was recorded at Phonos, Barcelona, on 27 and 28 October 2021, with kind support from ICFO. It was presented live at Barcelona’s Sónar Festival, special edition AI+Music, on October 28th, 2021.
