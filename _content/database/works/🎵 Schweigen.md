### **Synopsis**

Schweigen (2023) demonstrates a possible application of quantum computational algorithms in the formal structure of a composition. Presenting a section from L. Wittgenstein's “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus”, it places Wittgenstein´s ideas in a quantum world.

Durations of the chords were set by converting a function into probability amplitudes using Quantum Probability Amplitude Modulation (Itaboraí & Miranda, 2022). The function establishes the overall accelerating form. Deviations from the function were created by setting suitable number of trials for the quantum circuit. Inspired by G. Grisey\`s idea of “statistical acceleration” (Grisey, 1987), more unpredictable temporal structure is achieved but the overall acceleration is kept.
