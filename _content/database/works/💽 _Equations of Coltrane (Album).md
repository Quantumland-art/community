As we enter into a new era where computation will be driven by the laws of quantum mechanics this new electro-acoustic duo, NpHz, explores the connection between quantum physics and music, Jazz, improvisation and creativity. NpHz features OCH (Omar Costa Hamido) and Scott Oshiro: two artist-researchers working in music and technology focusing on improvised Music and Quantum Computing (QC). In their work they explore the potential advantages QC can provide for music composition. In this performance several quantum computer music compositions are presented using live acoustic instruments, a quantum synthesizer, and a quantum computer improvisation system.

[[üë§ Scott Oshiro]] - flute, electronics

Scott is a Bay Area based flutist, electronic musician, music researcher and music technologist. As an African and Okinawan American, Scott‚Äôs creative and academic work incorporates musical elements from his heritage and combines them with Jazz, Hip Hop and Electronic music. He is currently a 5th year PhD student at the Center for Computer Research in Music & Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University where he researches the intersection of quantum computing, music and culture. He has received awards for his work on quantum audio signal processing algorithms with higher order states, and has been published in ‚ÄúQuantum Computer Music: Foundations, Methods and Advanced Concepts‚Äù (edited by Dr. Eduardo Miranda) for his work on quantum beat generation. Currently, Scott is developing a real-time quantum computer music improvisation generation system that will be used in composing music for an album (Featuring Asian Improv Arts musicians along with other BIPOC artists from the Bay Area) illustrating the connections between music and science.

[[üë§ OCH]] - saxophone, electronics

OCH is a performer, composer, and technologist, working primarily in multimedia and improvisation. His current research is on quantum computing and music composition, telematics, and multimedia. He is passionate about emerging technology, cinema, teaching, and performing new works. He earned his PhD in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology at University of California, Irvine with his research project Adventures in Quantumland (quantumland.art). He also earned his MA in Music Theory and Composition at ESMAE-IPP Portugal with his research on the relations between music and painting. In recent years, his work has been recognized with grants and awards from MSCA, Fulbright, Funda√ß√£o para a Ci√™ncia e a Tecnologia, Medici, Beall Center for Art+Technology, and IBM.
