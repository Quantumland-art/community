### **Synopsis**

According to Walter Smetak, musical instruments come from a process of acoustic research in which the ITINERARY OF SOUND is examined. This paints the notion that a musical instrument's function is to Carry sound. "Rever" , is an artistic/improvisation processÂ  that explores the notion of a Quantum Itinerary of Sound quite literally: From Quantum, to Digital, to Analog. The sounds are created as (quantum) signals, transformed into digital wavetables, then sent overseas to Brazil, where it is synthesized and embedded into a 1974 Moog 15 analog patch and connect us to the early days of electronic music.
