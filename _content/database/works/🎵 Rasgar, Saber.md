### **Synopsis**

In 1958, Meyer-Eppler highlighted the importance of artistic experimentation with emerging technologies: "Research into electrical methods of generating sound or noise has revealed a large number of phenomena which can only be discovered in instrumental sounds after the ear has been prepared by electroacoustic experiments". Analogously, this could be extrapolated to quantum computing. To reveal the encoding/decoding methods of generating sound materials with quantum representations of audio is TO TEAR a barrier (like a piece of paper), a rupture to prepare the ear TO KNOW about quantum measurements. The piece uses sounds from paper to train our quantum listening.
