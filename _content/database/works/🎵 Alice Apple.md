### **Synopsis**

Alice Apple (2022) is a live-coded multi-channel work created at the Virginia Tech 2022 I4 Residency consisting of a variational quantum circuit synthesizer that generates a large number of discrete outputs modulated by the outputs from an entangled six qubit circuit simulation. The work references the groundbreaking FM modulation synthesis processes of electronic music pioneer Morton Subotnick entitled “Silver Apples of the Moon.”
