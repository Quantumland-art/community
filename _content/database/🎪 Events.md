this is an index of events.
it doesn't matter what I write here, since the contents of this page are being replaced with a programmatically generated list of entries with the `events` category.
It does help the graph nodes to just have the entries simply listed here though. But I have also implemented a way to programmatically generate the graph node links (as well as backlinks), even if this page is empty. On the other hand though, it would be good to just list the pages here, so that it registers this database's date of last updated...
