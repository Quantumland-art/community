title: ‚ùì Markdown

Markdown is a simple language used in text files (usually `.md` files) that allows some minimal styling. You will see it being used all over github: on `README.md` files, on issue posts, and even on [forum](https://community.quantumland.art/forum) discussion posts! You can click and drag an image into a github post, add section headers, bold, italic, and more.
